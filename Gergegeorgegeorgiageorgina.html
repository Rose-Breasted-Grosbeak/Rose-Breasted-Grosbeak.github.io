	<h1>Oranges & Limes</h1>
	<p>To begin with, my friend likes to think nothing looks good on her because of one reason or another. <strong>I'm</strong> of the belief that this line of thought is because 1) she lacks <strong>confidence</strong> in herself and 2) she doesn't really understand the importance of many factors that go into designing an outfit in general and tailored to one's body and tone! </p>
	<p>So, after some convincing (one such reason that may seem very random but will come up in a future costume I'll present) I was finally given chance to 'dress' her up.</p>
	<p>Naturally, this meant I was allowed any style and material that I could dream up. This kind of freedom on someone who refused any diversity in her outfits and taste was one I would embrace fully. She doesn't wear color, so I will find vibrant colors which fit her skin tone and wig. She only wears loose-fitting clothes, so I will (within comfortable reason--I am not so evil!) tailor a sillhouette that embraces a bit of form-fitting. She does not accessorize, so I will layer that shit on!</p>
	<p>First, to combat her very wrong impression that her shoulders are wide (offensive because my shoulders are <em>actually</em> wide) I knew I had to go with a long-sleeve top that had a dropped shoulder design. Since I didn't want to make her too out of her comfort zone, I decided to go with a sweater that tightens around the waist and at the end of the sleeves, but keep the rest of the sweater on the looser side. I wanted to incorporate necklaces, but with a top like this it would've seemed a little off, so I could go with bracelets instead! So the long sleeves became 3/4 sleeves and no one can go wrong with a turtle neck!</p>
	<p> As you can imagine, the idea of bangles, tight at the right places, and a turtle neck meant I had to make the color scheme a retro one.</p>
